# js-step #

Step through JavaScript using JavaScript.  Based in part on Amjad Masad's
debugjs project â€“ https://github.com/amasad/debugjs.

## Difference from debugjs ##
- js-step doesn't use an iframe to isolate the code it's running.  This is your
responsibility.  One way to do this is to run js-step inside a iframe with the
code that you want to step through and communicate with js-step using postMessage.
- js-step is a work in progress and doesn't have support for a lot of things.

## TODO ##
- interface to control execution
- setting breakpoints
- stepping inside user defined functions
- getting a list of variables in the current scope
- ...
