<h1>Stepper</h1>
<p>
    Stepper is a JavaScript library for debgging JavaScript.  This may be
    used to present a simplified and/or consistent debugging interface to novice
    programmers who are just learning to use a debugger.  It might also be used
    in the future to implement things like event recording and playback which
    current browser debuggers don't support.
</p>
<p>
    It uses ES6 Generators to which allow flow control to exit a function and
    then re-enter it at the same place that it left using the <b>yield</b> keyword.
    For more information see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*">function* [MDN]</a>.
    I plan on writing some blog posts that describe the inner workings in more
    detail... stay tuned.
</p>
<p>
    It supports the following features:
    <ul>
        <li>breakpoints (click to the left of the line number)</li>
        <li>stepping in/over/out</li>
        <li>callstack listing</li>
        <li>local variables</li>
        <li>inspecting recursive data structures</li>
        <li>proper timing for events that occur while paused</li>
    </ul>

<p>
    The demo uses <a href="http://processingjs.org/reference/">processing.js</a>
    as a library.  The are many things that don't work yet, but the biggest one
    is that you can't pass user defined functions as callbacks to built-in functions...
    yet (right now the "draw" function is being special cased).
